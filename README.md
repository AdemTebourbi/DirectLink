# DirectLink

**File Sharing Made Seamless for Developers**

## Overview

DirectLink is a purpose-built file-sharing application, tailored for local and remote collaboration among developers dealing with large files such as 3D models and high-quality textures. It opens two HTTP services, facilitating administration (port 3000) and file access (port 3001). Setting up the application involves creating a virtual server on port 3001 within router settings.

## Usage

1. **Access Administration Interface:**
   - Launch the app and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to enter the DirectLink Administration.
   - Here, users can effortlessly create shared directories by specifying a name, local directory path, and a password for secure access.

2. **Unique Sharing Links:**
   - Direct Link generates unique links for sharing files with collaborators. These links, often starting with the public IP address and port 3001, provide direct access to shared directories.

3. **Flexible Management:**
   - Manage shared directories seamlessly through the administration interface.
   - Delete or stop sharing specific directories effortlessly, ensuring control and security.

4. **Developer-Friendly Collaboration:**
   - Direct Link revolutionizes collaboration for developers working with large files.
   - Eliminate the need for file uploads to external platforms. Instead, share directories directly from your computer.
